***Pong*** is a [table tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis)â€“themed [twitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_gameplay) arcade [sports video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game), featuring simple [two-dimensional graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics), manufactured by [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari,_Inc) and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest [arcade video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_video_game); it was created by [Allan Alcorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Alcorn) as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder [Nolan Bushnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell), but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the [Magnavox Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey), the first [home video game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_video_game_console). In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.
